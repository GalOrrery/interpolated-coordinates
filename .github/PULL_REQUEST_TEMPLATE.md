- [ ] Do the proposed changes follow the [Astropy coding guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html)?
- [ ] Are tests added/updated as required? If so, do they follow the [Astropy testing guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/testguide.html)?

- [ ] Is a change log needed? If yes, did the change log check pass? If no, add the `no-changelog-entry-needed` label. If this is a manual backport, use the `skip-changelog-checks` label unless special changelog handling is necessary.
- [ ] Is a milestone set? Milestone must be set but `astropy-bot` check might be missing; do not let the green checkmark fool you.
- [ ] At the time of adding the milestone, if the milestone set requires a backport to release branch(es), apply the appropriate `backport-X.Y.x` label(s) *before* merge.
